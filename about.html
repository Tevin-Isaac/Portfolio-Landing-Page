        <h2>Reason I chose to take Moringa School programming class </h2>

        <p>So it was through having an online business via facebook that i got to get an email about a hackathon that Facebook had organized called "Build for SDG Cohort".This was an opportunity for me to join other developers and learn since it was free.
            So i enrolled and luckily i got a Kenyan team and i found other developers who were proffessional and way advance in terms of software development skills.But this did not stop me i confidently asked them to include me and at first since i
            was not familiar with the programming languages i just floated and saw what each of them was doing. So after that hackathon unfortunately we did not win or get shortlisted by investors but it brought us together to build a team of 6 members.
            We then enrolled for another hackathon the next month and this was abit tougher because it was a blockchain DApp contest under the Celo Platform. The only knowledge i had of coding was the one i got from Sololearn mobile Application.Unfortunately
            the things we were doing in that project were abit advance from what i learnt but luckily i picked the pace. Eventually we made a mobile Dapp and we were able to win as a Kenyan team under Celo.One of the team members was offered to be an
            Ambassador of Celo in Kenya and the rest of us were awarded financially too. So that is when i decided to take this course from Moringa school and try and familiarize and advance my skills.Since i enrolled its been easy to understand and i
            know its going to build my skills proffessionally now as a mobile developer and also its going to enable me participate in a Hackathon team if i ever work on another project again.
